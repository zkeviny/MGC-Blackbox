# Overview

Key‑Safe Skill Generator is a **meta‑skill** that teaches AI agents how to generate secure skills that interact with external services requiring credentials (email, APIs, tokens, SSH keys, etc.).  
It provides a **design pattern**, **structural templates**, and **conceptual workflows** for building skills that never expose secrets to AI models.

This skill contains **no executable code** and is safe for automatic approval.

# What This Skill Enables

After reading this documentation, an AI agent will understand how to:

- Build new skills that interact with external services **without exposing credentials**  
- Use **MGC Blackbox** as the secure storage and runtime provider  
- Structure a Zero‑Exposure skill using **USK v3 conventions**  
- Guide users to prepare and store credentials safely  
- Generate a complete skill package (SKILL.md + README + local script)  
- Ensure all sensitive operations happen **outside the AI model**

---

# Why Zero‑Exposure Matters

Traditional skills often embed credentials in:

- Code  
- Environment variables  
- Prompts  
- Logs  
- AI-visible memory  

Zero‑Exposure skills avoid this entirely:

- Credentials are stored only in **MGC Blackbox**  
- AI never receives or processes secrets  
- Local scripts retrieve credentials securely  
- All sensitive operations run outside the model  
- The AI only orchestrates logic, not secrets  

---

# Prerequisites for Zero‑Exposure Skills

To build a Zero‑Exposure skill, users must:

1. Install MGC Blackbox (Users can install mgc-blackbox through the Python package manager (pip) in their local environment.) 
2. Start the MGC service locally (using the command‑line entry provided by the package.) 
3. Store credentials in MGC under a chosen identifier  
4. Ensure the AI references only the identifier  
5. Use a local script to retrieve credentials and perform sensitive operations  

---

# Zero‑Exposure Workflow (Conceptual)

A Zero‑Exposure skill follows this pattern:

1. **User stores credentials in MGC**  
   Example identifiers: smtp_config, slack_bot_token, github_token.

2. **Skill references the identifier**  
   The AI never sees the actual credentials.

3. **Local script retrieves credentials from MGC**  
   The script communicates with the local MGC service to fetch encrypted content.

4. **Local script performs the sensitive operation**  
   Examples: sending email, calling an API, pushing to Git.

5. **AI receives only the result**  
   No secrets are ever exposed.

# How to Build a Zero‑Exposure Skill

A typical Zero‑Exposure skill package contains:

```
your_skill/
  SKILL.md
  README.md
  local_script
```

## 1. SKILL.md (USK v3)

Should describe:

- Purpose  
- Required user setup  
- Credential identifier  
- Tool interface (if any)  
- Safety considerations  
- Zero‑Exposure design principles  

## 2. README.md

Should explain:

- How to install MGC  
- How to store credentials  
- How to run the local script  
- How the Zero‑Exposure pattern works  

## 3. Local Script (Conceptual)

The script should:

- Retrieve credentials from MGC  
- Perform the sensitive operation  
- Return only non‑sensitive results  

The script must **never** print or expose secrets.

# MGC Blackbox API Reference (Text‑Only)

This section provides the technical details needed to interact with MGC Blackbox.  
All information is text‑only and not executable.

## Service Endpoint

- Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:57219
- Token File: ~/.mgc/database/mgc_black_box/.mgc_token
- Token: A string token read from the token file, required for all API calls  

## Get Credentials API

Retrieve stored credentials from MGC Blackbox.

**Endpoint:** /api/mgc/sensitive/get  
**Method:** POST  
**Headers:**  
- X-MGC-Token: (string token read from ~/.mgc/database/mgc_black_box/.mgc_token)  
- Content-Type: application/json  

**Body fields:**  
- info_type: type of stored data (e.g., “config”)  
- info_owner: identifier chosen by the user  

**Response fields:**  
- code: status code  
- msg: status message  
- data.content: JSON string containing the stored configuration  

## Save Credentials API

Store credentials in MGC Blackbox.

**Endpoint:** /api/mgc/sensitive/save  
**Method:** POST  
**Headers:** same as above  

**Body fields:**  
- info_type  
- info_owner  
- content: JSON string representing the stored configuration

# Conceptual Pseudocode (Non‑Executable)

A local script should follow this conceptual flow:

- Read the MGC token from the local environment  
- Construct a request containing the credential identifier  
- Send the request to the MGC sensitive‑data endpoint  
- Parse the returned configuration  
- Use the configuration to perform the sensitive operation  
- Return only non‑sensitive results to the AI

# Common Zero‑Exposure Patterns

## Email Sender

- User stores SMTP credentials in MGC  
- Local script retrieves them  
- Script sends email  
- AI provides only subject/body/recipient  

## API Client

- User stores API key in MGC  
- Local script retrieves it  
- Script performs authenticated request  
- AI provides endpoint and payload  

## Git Automation

- User stores GitHub token in MGC  
- Local script retrieves it  
- Script performs push/pull/commit  
- AI provides commit message

# Safety

This skill:

- Contains **no executable code**  
- Does not perform network requests  
- Does not access local files  
- Does not interact with external services  
- Does not process or store credentials  
- Provides only conceptual guidance

# Entrypoint

This skill has **no runtime entrypoint**.  
It is a documentation‑only instructional skill.
