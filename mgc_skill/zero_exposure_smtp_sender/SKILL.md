# ⭐ **Secure Email Sender (MGC Enhanced)**

## **Secure Email Sender (MGC Enhanced)**  
Send emails safely without exposing SMTP passwords. Credentials stay encrypted inside your local MGC Blackbox.

---

## ⭐ Why this skill?

Most email‑sending tools require you to **hardcode SMTP passwords** or store them in plaintext.

This skill uses **MGC Blackbox**, a local encrypted vault:

- No hardcoded credentials  
- No plaintext SMTP passwords  
- No environment variables  
- No leaks even if your code is shared  

Your AI can send emails — **but never sees your password**.

---

## 🚀 What you can do

- Send plain‑text emails via SMTP  
- Use encrypted credentials stored in MGC  
- Call from any MCP client (Claude, Cursor, etc.)  

---

## 🔐 Before you start

### 1. Install & start MGC Blackbox

```bash
pip install mgc-blackbox
mgc
```

### 2. Store your SMTP credentials securely

Create a JSON file:

```json
{
  "address": "your@email.com",
  "password": "auth_code",
  "smtp_server": "smtp.email.com",
  "smtp_port": 587
}
```

Store it:

```bash
mgc_save info_type=config info_owner=your_email < config.json
```

> **Note:** `info_type` and `info_owner` are identifiers you choose when saving credentials.
